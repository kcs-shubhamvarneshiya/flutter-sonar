around the Indian subcontinent for 7 years during his teenage years. Nilkanth Varni is portrayed in an ascetic pose performing tapas, or penance and worship with intense self-discipline. He performed rigorous tapas for six months, standing on one leg in a yogic posture, and mastered yoga during his travels in the Himalayas. His emaciated body glows with the aura of his determined posture and inward drawn eyes. The bronze murti is 49 feet tall to commemorate the 49 years Bhagwan Swaminarayan lived on earth while affecting social and spiritual reform in India. Large outdoor murtis such as these have been installed for centuries to express reverence and inspire spiritual living in Hindu, Buddhist and Jain traditions.","thumbnail":"https://www.baps.org/Data/Sites/1/Media/GalleryImages/23484/WebImages/16_Tapomurti_Nilkanth_Varni_Murti_Sthapan.jpg","heroImage":"https://www.baps.org/Data/Sites/1/Media/GalleryImages/23484/WebImages/16_Tapomurti_Nilkanth_Varni_Murti_Sthapan.jpg","images":["https://www.baps.org/Data/Sites/1/Media/GalleryImages/23484/WebImages/01_Tapomurti_Nilkanth_Varni_Murti_Sthapan.jpg","https://www.baps.org/Data/Sites/1/Media/GalleryImages/23484/WebImages/19_Tapomurti_Nilkanth_Varni_Murti_Sthapan.jpg","https://www.baps.org/Data/Sites/1/Media/GalleryImages/23484/WebImages/51_Tapomurti_Nilkanth_Varni_Murti_Sthapan.jpg","https://www.baps.org/Data/Sites/1/Media/GalleryImages/23484/WebImages/93_Tapomurti_Nilkanth_Varni_Murti_Sthapan.jpg"],"radius":20,"type":"Outdoor Attraction","duration":"1","options":{"reservable":true,"isRecommended":true,"externalLink":"url"},"displayOrder":{"exploreList":10,"visitPlanner":10},"beacon":null,"longitude":"72.5422683","latitude":"23.0376497","mapIcon":"Bal Nagari","attractionType":"Experiences","notificationMessage":{"body":"You are near baps department.","title":"5th floor rysun","deepLink":null}},{"id":9,"title":"Traditional Stepwell","description":"Behind the murti of Nilkanth Varni is a stepwell modeled in the tradition of historical stepwells and architectural masterpieces of his time, such as Rani ki VÃ£v in Patan, Gujarat.
